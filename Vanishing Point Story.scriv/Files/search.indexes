	–– The Overstory, Richard Powers

Plot Elements: 
	•	Brent is a single father to his 12-year-old daughter, Eloise.
	•	The game takes place in a 2006 snapshot of their family computer. 
	•	Eloise skipped two grades in school and struggles to relate to other kids in her grade. 
	•	At the time of the snapshot, Brent was hyperfocusing on a work project called Asphodel.
	•	Echo was made using Asphodel.
	•	Echo is sentient.
	•	The OS corruption has spread to Echo’s personality files(?) &amp; it’s missing some functionality.
	•	Asphodel is an algorithm(?) that generates an AI based on the user’s personality.
	•	Echo was the first AI to exist––it was trained on Brent’s personality and acts like him.
	•	Echo knows someone is using the computer and thinks that person is Brent.
	•	The company Brent works for planned to use the software to steal and sell user data. 
	•	Brent stole Echo and Asphodel and hid them both on his family computer. 
	•	Brent was killed by the company he worked for. 
	•	The player is an older version of Eloise. 
	•	Echo will act more like Eloise the more she interacts with it.

Well, sure, you can go. What time?

Four. I’m supposed to bring a snack or something? She said I can bring anything as long as it isn’t chips because that’s what everyone else is bringing. Do you think I can just wear my regular clothes?

In the very beginning, Echo can have more of a traditional virtual assistant role.
The first level can be finding the personality of this thing, the second level can be finding the actual source code. 
We should call the spatial audio echoes––unless that would confuse the player and make them think echo is a generic term. 
Maybe the 2D player-character is based on Eloise instead––she was the one who cracked Asphodel when Brent brought his project home from work. 
Maybe the spatial audio is something the software is overhearing?
He tells them they can’t use her brain scan and then he gets to work the next day and finds out they already have it. 
Maybe Eloise’s dad asked her to make sure the project gets deleted, so what she’s doing is going through and deleting everything.
Brent could have told Echo to deliver a message?
The game becomes about whatever card you put in the cinematic slot.

SCREENPLAY FORMAT
        by
   Keith Blount
FADE IN:
INT. A MESSY LIVING ROOM - DAY
KB sits at his laptop, pondering upon the nature of
screenplay format. The INTERNET helps him.
                    KB
          How does this work then?
                    INTERNET
          We have an imaginary conversation
          about script format. It's not very
          sophisticated or imaginative, but
          you have a hangover.
                    KB
               (embarrassed)
          That's true. So is it easy to
          create a standard Hollywood-
          formatted screenplay in Scrivener,
          then?
                    INTERNET
          Fairly. This PDF file was in fact
          created in Scrivener, using the
          basic Screenplay project template.
          The text was typing using Script
          Mode from the Format &gt;
          Scriptwriting menu, and then the
          whole thing was turned into a PDF
          file using Compile (File &gt;
          Compile...).
                    KB
          Handy. Right, how should margins be
set up, then?
                    INTERNET
          The left margin should be 1.5
          inches, all others should be about
          an inch. Scrivener's standard
          script elements start half an inch
          from the left margin in the editor,
          so if you print or export with one
          inch margins all around, everything
          should be dandy.
                    KB
          What about fonts?
                    INTERNET
          As usual with manuscript
1
          formatting, the standard is a
          Courier 12-point font.
KB thinks for a moment before continuing.
                    KB
          What about bold and italics? Can I
use them?
                    INTERNET
          Hell no. No bold, no italics;
          nothing fancy.
                    KB
          Can we go to another scene now?
Suddenly, KB gets sucked into the computer.
INT. INSIDE THE COMPUTER - DAY
KB looks around.
                    KB
               (looking around)
What the--
                    INTERNET (V.O.)
          That was a scene heading. All caps.
          And this is a voice-over, for no
          particular reason.
                    KB
          Okay, so this is your basic script
          format, then. Okay. So how do I get
          my script out into Final Draft?
                    INTERNET (V.O.)
          Just select Final Draft (FDX)
          format from the Compile sheet (File
          &gt; Compile...). If you have a title
          page, be sure to tick "First
          document is title page" in the
          "Script Settings" pane of Compile.
          The great thing about exporting to
          the FDX format is that all of the
          scene synopses, titles and script
          notes will get taken across to
          Final Draft too.
                    KB
          And what if I want to get my Final
          Draft script back into Scrivener?
2
          INTERNET
You could just drag your FDX file
into Scrivener's binder or use File
&gt; Import &gt; Files..., but probably
the best way is to use File &gt;
Import &gt; Import and Split... This
will break up your Final Draft
script into separate scenes in the
binder, and will import Final Draft
scene summaries into the document
synopses in Scrivener.
          KB
Cool. Can I go home now? It's
teatime.
THE END
FADE OUT.

            <Title>Clippy Notes</Title>
            <Text>“Clifford Nass and Byron (?) Reeves have done some pioneering work proving conclusively that human beings react to computers with the same set of emotional reactions that they use to react to other human beings. If I take a solid object, if I pick up a pencil or book and I throw it on the floor, nobody thinks too much about it––but if I go over and hit somebody, everybody goes “whoa”. [They proved that] when people interact with their computer with a keyboard or mouse, the part of their brain that’s being activated is the one that has that emotional reaction to people dealing with people.
“Here’s where the great mistake was made. […] If people react to computers as though they’re people, we have to put the faces of people on our computers. In my mind, that’s the wrong thing to do. If people are going to react to computers as though they’re people, the one thing you don’t have to do is anthropomorphize them––because they’re already using that part of the brain.
“Clippy was a program based on the research that Nass and Reeves did, and it was a tragic misinterpretation of their work.” 
––––Alan Cooper

The quotation above is describing the CASA (Computers As Social Actors) theory, which states that users instinctively treat computers like people. CASA theory refers to unconscious social responses––in fact, many of the participants who are questioned after experiments emphatically deny the very behavior they just exhibited. 
Modern humans presented with interactive media will unconsciously respond to those media in a social way––even if they know (consciously) that those media are in fact not real humans. People don’t need much of a cue to respond socially––plain text has been found to trigger the same social responses as more vivid technologies such as voice. 
What kind of traits trigger this unconscious response? 
	1)	Language use
	2)	Interactivity
	3)	Playing a social role
	4)	Having human-sounding speech
Adding agents tends to make the system more entertaining. 
“While CASA theory does not, in itself, justify the use of user interface agents, anthropomorphic or not, if one does use an anthropomorphic interface, that will certainly be enough to trigger an unconscious––and, likely, conscious––social response to the agent.” CASA theory predicts that psychological rules that apply to people will also apply to interactions with a computer. One must ask, “What would one want in a human assistant?” Many of the Office Assistant’s behaviors would be outright intolerable in a human, such as continuing to ask the same question over and over.” The letter-writing proactive help feature breaks every relevant etiquette rule: it ignores social conventions of when to disturb someone, it does not learn from its mistakes, it does not develop a long-term relationship, and it does not even provide a helpful service!
A friend told me that she doesn’t like the Office Assistant because “it reminds me of how much I don’t know.” For her, the Office Assistant is not unlike the flashing “12:00” on so many VCRs.
Users found joke-telling agents more tedious than ones that did not tell jokes, but also found the website more fun and reliable. Users found jokes more fun when they were not paired with a character. 
Tips for adding agents to a system:
	•	Consider the agents’ task in its social element (for example, beginners may want to rely on more experienced users for help and guidance—how can one facilitate this?).
	•	Agents should obey human rules of etiquette as much as possible (if one doesn’t like a person who disobeys these rules, one will especially dislike a computer agent that disobeys them!).
	•	Explore ways to use the agent to teach users skills to make them more self-sufficient (thus allowing users to retain a sense of control over the program).
	•	Carefully introduce the agent so as to realistically showcase its best features—and be sure that the appearance and behavior are consistent with that introduction (for example, if one calls the agent “fun,” there should be something fun about it!).

See “Why People Hate the Paperclip: Labels, Appearance, Behavior, and Social Responses to User Interface Agents,” by Luke Swartz (an undergraduate thesis paper advised by Clifford Nass)

The first and third levels should be reflections of each other just like level 2-A and level 2-B (the game is a palindrome). 

In the first level, the spaces should be lived-in and populated accordingly. How might the space have changed in the third level?

	•	Edit the “Title Page” document inside the “Front Matter” folder to ensure it contains the correct information.
	⁃	“&lt;$PROJECTTITLE&gt;” and “&lt;$fullname&gt;” will be filled in during Compile if you fill in the Metadata pane of the Compile panel, or you can just replace these tags with the title and name in the text document.
	•	Create new documents inside the “Screenplay” folder and use Scrivener’s script mode (Format &gt; Scriptwriting &gt; Script Mode - Screenplay) to write your script. It’s up to you whether you use a separate document for each scene or not.
	⁃	Note that the “Screenplay” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder” - it’s just been renamed in this project.
	•	Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
	•	Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
	⁃	You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
	⁃	To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
	⁃	Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit cmd-N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
	•	A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
	•	Compile your script for printing or exporting by selecting File &gt; Compile.

A Note on Fonts
By default, Scrivener uses the “Courier Prime” font for scriptwriting, which has similar dimensions to the “Courier Final Draft” font used by Final Draft. However, because “Courier Prime” is bundled inside Scrivener and is not a system font, it may not be available to other applications. This means that if you export a script using Courier Prime to, say, Word format, and Word does not have access to Courier Prime, Word will substitute a different font and your script may look very different.

To avoid this, the Compile settings for this template are set up to substitute Courier Prime for regular Courier, which has slightly different dimensions and may make the screenplay a little longer. If you only ever plan to compile this project for printing, or for exporting to PDF or Final Draft formats (which are not affected by this problem), you may therefore wish to turn off this override and have Scrivener compile using Courier Prime. To do so, in Compile, beneath where it says “Section Layouts” at the top, change the “Font” setting from “Courier” to “Determined by Section Layout” (right at the top of the list).

Sample Document
See the “Sample Script” PDF file in the Research folder for an example of a script that has been created using this template.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to scriptwriters. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Title>L2 Drafting - 16 February 2022</Title>
            <Text>What needs to be conveyed: 

Outline
	1	An introductory narrative text or cinematic that establishes the present identity of the player-character and her goal.
	2	Eloise starts the game on her side of the computer. (Snapshot of the ordinary world)
	3	She finds an entry point into her father’s account: an audio clip that mentions the Drive. 
	4	
	5	REVERSAL: the project was evil &amp; her dad was killed
	6	

The spaces are structured like a brain. Files and concepts are related to each other by association.

We need to open a channel of communication between the player-character and the player, however clumsy that might be. 
	•	Updates in an email chain between her and the developer of Asphodel?
	•	Maybe just the intro and the ending of the game can be enough. 

The thoughts(/files) that would be most likely to appear on a home computer would be ones that are somehow related to the intersection between Brent’s home and work life. 
	•	When will he be home from work? 
	•	Is he missing out on anything by spending so much time working on the project?
	•	Did he ever bring his daughter into the office?
	•	

To further develop the relationship between Eloise and her father, juxtapose domestic audio with the workplace setting, particularly in the latter half of the level when everything begins to break down. 

Red - anger
Blue - sadness
Yellow - happiness
Purple - fear
Green - domestic

Her father’s death looked like a car accident. 

The computer wouldn’t know anything past the point when Brent took the project back to his home computer. 

What is the actual negative effect that the software will have on the public if it launches?



Sounds:
	•	Ringing phone
